<h3> A real life project for my CSE299 course in university.</h3>
 <h2> <center> Video Membership Web App  </center> </h2> 
<h4> 1.	Project Idea in brief: </h4> <br>

A video membership web app where trainer and teachers from anywhere can upload their video courses and students can buy them. The main focus of my web app is to build a successful web based learning platform to all learners. 
 
The problem I am trying to solve:

Students from different places cannot join in a class to learn from some very prestigious teachers of all over the world. At the same time it is impossible to make a classroom for a teacher to teach the students. For this kind of problem I made a solution to all teachers and students as well.

Solving the problem by using my product:

For this kind of problem I came up with an web app idea that will help to all teachers and students as well. It’s a video membership web app called Srvup . Here students and teachers can sign up and get their profile. Teachers will upload their video courses and paid coruses as well and students enroll them by paying the course fee.

<h4> 2. Features : </h4>

a)	Sign Up and log in :  

•	Students can sign up for the course.

d)	Categories/ tags :

<h4> 3. Technology : </h4>

e)	Version control and code manage : GitHub, git

<h4> 4. Business Plan: </h4>
  
      As it is a paid service for students so there will be a Mastercard for foreign students and then Bkash for local students. They will purchase by paying the course fee. The system owner or the main admin will get a specific amount of money as a service charge.
